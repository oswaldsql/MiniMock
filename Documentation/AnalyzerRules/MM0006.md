# MM0006 :  Can not create mock for a sealed class

MiniMock does not support creating mocks for sealed classes. This is because the MiniMock framework uses inheritance to create mocks. Sealed classes cannot be inherited from, so MiniMock cannot create a mock for a sealed class.

The following code will raise this error:

```csharp
    public sealed class SealedClass
    {
        ///...
    }
    
    [Mock<SealedClass>]
    public void TestMethod()
    {
        //...
    }    
```
