# MM0005 : Static abstract members not supported

Static abstract members are not supported by MiniMock. Will not be supported due to the nature of the library.

```csharp
    public interface IStaticAbstractInterfaceMembers
    {
        static abstract string AbstractProperty { get; set; }
        static abstract string AbstractMethod();
        static abstract event EventHandler StaticEvent;
    }
```
