# Approach to Documentation and Examples

## Context

Effective documentation and examples are crucial for the adoption and proper use of any framework. Clear and concise documentation helps developers understand the framework's features and usage. Providing relevant examples can further illustrate how to implement and utilize the framework in real-world scenarios.

## Decision

We will create concise documentation and examples for the MiniMock framework. The documentation will cover essential aspects of the framework, including installation, configuration, and usage. Examples will be provided to demonstrate common use cases.

## Consequences

### Positive:

- **Clarity**: Clear and concise documentation will help developers understand how to use the framework effectively.
- **Adoption**: Good documentation and examples can increase the adoption rate of the framework.
- **Support**: Reduces the need for support by providing answers to common questions and issues.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent usage of the framework across different projects.

### Negative:

- **Effort**: Requires effort to create and maintain concise documentation and examples.
- **Maintenance**: Documentation must be kept up-to-date with any changes or updates to the framework.

## Documentation Structure

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the framework, its purpose, and key features.
2. **Getting Started**: Instructions on how to install and configure the framework.
3. **Usage Guide**: Detailed guide on how to use the framework, including API references.
4. **Examples**: Practical examples demonstrating common use cases.
5. **FAQ**: Frequently asked questions and troubleshooting tips.

## Examples
