# Support for Abstract Classes (WIP)

Abstract classes are supported to a limited extent. The framework will allow mocking of abstract classes, but only if the abstract class has a public or protected constructor with no parameters.
Support for abstract classes with constructors that have parameters will be supported in the future.

Work in progress.
